# Housing-Price-Analysis
Analysis of California Housing Prices <br>
The given notebook provides information on California houses and their prices in regards to districts and gives statistical methods of predicting the price of a house. The following python libraries are used for exploring, preprocessing, training, fine-tuning, and deployment:
* Pandas -> analysis of data, its columns, features, and correlations
* Matplotlib -> visualization of data and graphing the correlations
* Scikit-learn -> preprocessing, training, and fine-tuning, its the core library for this notebook
* joblib -> saving the model for deployment
<br>
The notebook utilizes various concepts in statistcs, such as simple random sampling, stratified ransom sampling, distributions, CDFs, and statiscal learning models.

Results of the project
<br>Final results suggest that Random Forest with Randomized Search Cross Validation gives the most optimal result with an error of 41424.4. The precision interval of the model is [39275.4, 43467.3] and our error is roughly in the middle.
